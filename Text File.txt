lets start by making a setup.py which i would place in a folder named groupify.... which when run would create the directories needed for this project inside a folder called "backend" for the backend part and start a flutter create frontend from the groupify main folder..... stacks to use frontend flutter backend appwrite db appwrite ai ollama in docker and containerise the whole project so that i can move from system to system if needed.


Here is a detailed action plan to build the "Groupify" app from scratch using the stack you've listed:

**I. Project Setup (groupify folder):**

```
groupify/
├── backend/         # Backend code
├── frontend/        # Flutter frontend code
├── docker/          # Docker configuration files
├── .gitignore
└── README.md
```

**II. Backend (backend/ folder):**

```
backend/
├── app/
│   ├── __init__.py
│   ├── main.py          # FastAPI application instance, routing
│   ├── api/
│   │   └── v1/
│   │       ├── __init__.py
│   │       ├── api.py       # Main API router
│   │       └── endpoints/
│   │           ├── __init__.py
│   │           ├── auth.py    # Authentication endpoints (Appwrite)
│   │           ├── chat.py    # Chat related endpoints
│   │           └── users.py   # User profile endpoints
│   ├── core/
│   │   ├── __init__.py
│   │   └── config.py      # Application settings
│   ├── crud/
│   │   ├── __init__.py
│   │   ├── chat.py        # CRUD operations for chats
│   │   └── user_profile.py # CRUD operations for user profiles
│   ├── models/
│   │   ├── __init__.py
│   │   ├── chat.py        # Chat model
│   │   └── user_profile.py # User profile model
│   ├── schemas/
│   │   ├── __init__.py
│   │   ├── chat.py        # Pydantic schemas for chat
│   │   └── user_profile.py # Pydantic schemas for user profile
│   └── utils/
│       ├── __init__.py
│       └── appwrite_client.py # Appwrite client initialization
├── alembic.ini        # Alembic configuration
├── alembic/           # Alembic migrations
├── requirements.txt   # Backend dependencies
└── Dockerfile         # Dockerfile for the backend
```

**Backend Modules and Details:**

* **`app/main.py`**: Initializes the FastAPI application, sets up middleware (CORS), includes routers.
* **`app/core/config.py`**: Manages application settings (e.g., Appwrite project ID, API key).
* **`app/utils/appwrite_client.py`**: Initializes the Appwrite client using the SDK.
* **`app/api/v1/api.py`**: Defines the main API router and includes endpoint-specific routers.
* **`app/api/v1/endpoints/auth.py`**: Handles user authentication using Appwrite's SDK (login, registration, session management).
* **`app/api/v1/endpoints/users.py`**: Manages user profile data in Appwrite's database.
* **`app/api/v1/endpoints/chat.py`**: Handles chat-related operations using Appwrite's database.
* **`app/models/chat.py`**: Defines the structure for chat data in Appwrite's database (using Appwrite's document structure).
* **`app/models/user_profile.py`**: Defines the structure for user profile data in Appwrite's database.
* **`app/schemas/chat.py`**: Pydantic schemas for validating chat data.
* **`app/schemas/user_profile.py`**: Pydantic schemas for validating user profile data.
* **`app/crud/chat.py`**: Contains functions for performing CRUD operations on chat data using the Appwrite SDK.
* **`app/crud/user_profile.py`**: Contains functions for performing CRUD operations on user profile data using the Appwrite SDK.
* **`requirements.txt`**: Lists dependencies like `fastapi`, `uvicorn`, `appwrite`, etc.
* **`Dockerfile`**: Instructions to build the Docker image for the backend.
* **`alembic/`**: While you're using Appwrite, you might not need Alembic for schema migrations unless you decide to use a separate database alongside Appwrite.

**III. Frontend (frontend/ folder):**

This will be a standard Flutter project structure created by `flutter create frontend`. Key directories include:

```
frontend/
├── android/
├── ios/
├── lib/             # Main Flutter application code
│   ├── main.dart
│   ├── widgets/
│   ├── screens/
│   └── services/
├── test/
├── web/
├── pubspec.yaml     # Flutter dependencies and project configuration
└── ... (other Flutter files)
```

**Frontend Modules and Details:**

* **`lib/main.dart`**: Entry point of your Flutter application, initializes the Appwrite SDK.
* **`lib/screens/`**: Contains Flutter screens for authentication (login, signup), chat interface, user profiles, etc.
* **`lib/widgets/`**: Reusable UI components.
* **`lib/services/`**: Contains services for interacting with the Appwrite backend API and Ollama (if you choose direct frontend integration for some AI features, though backend integration is generally preferred).
* **`pubspec.yaml`**: Lists Flutter dependencies, including the Appwrite Flutter SDK.

**IV. Docker Configuration (docker/ folder):**

```
docker/
├── docker-compose.yml   # Orchestrates all services
└── ollama/
    └── Dockerfile       # Optional: Custom Ollama Dockerfile
```

**Docker Compose (`docker-compose.yml`):**

```yaml
version: '3.8'
services:
  backend:
    build: ./backend
    ports:
      - "8000:8000"
    environment:
      - APPWRITE_ENDPOINT=YOUR_APPWRITE_ENDPOINT
      - APPWRITE_PROJECT_ID=YOUR_APPWRITE_PROJECT_ID
      # Add other environment variables as needed
    depends_on:
      - ollama

  frontend:
    build: ./frontend
    ports:
      - "3000:80"
    depends_on:
      - backend

  ollama:
    image: ollama/ollama:latest
    ports:
      - "11434:11434"
    volumes:
      - ollama_data:/root/.ollama

volumes:
  ollama_data:
```

* **`backend`**: Service for your FastAPI backend.
* **`frontend`**: Service for serving your Flutter web application (you'll need to build the Flutter web app and configure a web server like Nginx in your frontend Dockerfile).
* **`ollama`**: Service for the Ollama container.

**V. Deployment on OMV Server with Cloudflare Tunnel:**

1.  **Install Docker and Docker Compose:** Ensure Docker and Docker Compose are installed on your OMV server.
2.  **Install Cloudflare Tunnel Client:** Follow Cloudflare's documentation to install the `cloudflared` client on your OMV server.
3.  **Configure Cloudflare Tunnel:** Set up a tunnel to expose the ports your backend (8000) and frontend (3000) are running on within your Docker containers. You'll configure this using `cloudflared tunnel create` and then by editing the tunnel's configuration file.
4.  **Run Docker Compose:** Copy your `groupify` folder to your OMV server and run `docker-compose up -d` from the root of the project.
5.  **Access via Cloudflare Tunnel:** You will then be able to access your application via the Cloudflare Tunnel URLs you configured.

This action plan provides a comprehensive outline for building your application from scratch with the specified modules and technologies. Remember to consult the documentation for Flutter, Appwrite, FastAPI, and Ollama for detailed implementation guidance.
